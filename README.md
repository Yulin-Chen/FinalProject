# Kangaroo Jump 

Adapted from Doodle Jump, the Kangaroo Jump is a game with 2 kangaroos competing to jump upwards. Each platform for jumping upward will disappear after the the first Kangaroo that jumps onto that platform. The screen can infinitely moves up and will follow the Kangaroo that's at a higher position.

**Control**:
- "◀""▶" to control the kangaroo
- "Space" to shoot upward against your enemy kangaroo

**Tools:**
- Spring: you can land on them to jump higher
- Shield: you can use to protect yourself
- Rocket: you can use them to accelerate

**How to Win:**

You will win as soon as the bottom of the screen touches the opponent kangaroo or the life bar of the opponent kangaroo runs out - so jump as high as you can to win!
