# Kangaroo Jump 

Adapted from Doodle Jump, the Kangaroo Jump is a game with 2 kangaroos competing to jump upwards. Platforms for the kangaroo to jump on will disappear after whichever Kangaroo land on that platform first. The screen can infinitely scrolls up and will follow the Kangaroo that's at a higher position. Both Kangaroos are able to shoot bullets upward to attack their enemy kangaroo when they are at a disadvantage. The kangaroo will die (game over) when it either hits the bottom of the screen or has been shot three times. 

**Control**:
- "◀" "▶" to control the kangaroo A
- "A" "D" to control the kangaroo B
- "W" / "▲" to shoot upward against your enemy kangaroo

**Tools:**
- Spring: you can land on them to jump higher
- Shield: you can use to protect yourself
- Rocket: you can use them to accelerate

**How to Win:**

You will win as soon as the bottom of the screen touches the opponent kangaroo or the life bar of the opponent kangaroo runs out - so jump as high as you can to win!
